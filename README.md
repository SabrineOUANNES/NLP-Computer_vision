On the marketplace, sellers offer items to buyers by posting a photo and description.

Currently, assigning an item's category is done manually by sellers, and is therefore unreliable. In addition, the volume of items is currently very small.

To make the user experience for sellers (facilitate the posting of new articles) and buyers (facilitate the search for products) as smooth as possible, and with a view to scaling up, it becomes necessary to automate this task.

Linda, Lead Data Scientist, therefore asks you to study the feasibility of an engine for classifying articles into different categories, with a sufficient level of precision.
